## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a background in astrophysics but I am currently working as an epidemiologist on antimicrobial resistance surveilance in urban wastewater.

I have multiple bioinformatics projects going on, including a Bayesian read mapping tool for metagenomic data.

My primary programming language is Python, but I am fluent in C/C++ and Fortran too. I am also learning Rust, Go, and 6502 assembler. ðŸ˜„
